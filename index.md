**What you’ll find here (it’s a brain dump on purpose):**

- **LLMs & ML** — running models locally with vLLM, wiring tools via MCP, trying agents/RAG, prompt patterns, tiny automations.  
- **Engineering practice** — modeling & simulation notes, validation narratives, surrogate models from FEA results.  
- **Organization & data** — file frameworks, versioning heavy artifacts with DVC, evidence chains for decisions.  
- **Productivity & process** — sustainable focus, less friction, working in public.  
- **Life in motion** — honest notes on struggles, trade‑offs, and keeping momentum.
