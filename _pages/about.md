I'm a mechanical engineer (MEng) focused on **modeling & simulation**. Over the last **9+ years** I've worked across
high‑fidelity **FEA**, **Python** for data analysis, and **machine‑learning** for inverse problems—like estimating load/pressure
distributions from strain on real structures. I’ve deployed **vLLM** on a local GPU server to host models, trained **YOLO**
to detect objects in proprietary images, and built **surrogate models** from FEA results to speed up design loops.

The theme you’ll notice here: I enjoy turning messy, real‑world engineering into workflows we can **trust and reuse**—from
file organisation and data management to lightweight validation and reporting.

### Books that shape how I work (one‑liners)
- **Atomic Habits — James Clear:** compound the **1% gains**, design low‑friction environments for good habits, remove cues for bad ones.
- **Deep Work — Cal Newport:** protect **long, focused blocks** on one demanding task; reduce context switching; schedule depth and say no to shallow noise.
- **Trust Me, I’m Lying — Ryan Holiday:** media incentives skew toward **attention and outrage**; headlines are engineered to engage (and enrage).
- **The Happiness Trap — Russ Harris:** based on ACT—**presence over pursuit**; accept emotions, defuse from thoughts, act on values; even **schedule worry** instead of ruminating.

### What I’m writing about (brain dump by design)
- **LLMs & ML:** running **vLLM** locally, **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** integrations, experimenting with **agents**, RAG, prompt patterns, and tiny automations.
- **Engineering practice:** modeling & simulation notes, validation narratives, surrogate modeling from FEA results.
- **Organization & data:** file frameworks, DVC/versioning for heavy artifacts, evidence chains for decisions.
- **Productivity & process:** sustainable focus, small systems that reduce friction, working in public.
- **Life in motion:** honest notes on struggles, trade‑offs, and keeping momentum.
