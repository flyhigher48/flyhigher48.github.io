I started thinking hard about this after reading **Cal Newport’s** newsletter on a possible IQ decline and then catching some of his podcast ideas about retooling phone use. That sent me down a rabbit hole: do the data really show a drop, what might be causing it, and what can I change in my day? I’m not trying to prove a pre-set story—I’m trying to be accurate, own my habits, and keep improving.

## What the evidence actually says (short + honest)

* **U.S. online study (2006–2018) with big caveats**
  A Northwestern team found declines over time in several ability domains (verbal, matrix reasoning, letter/number series) and an **increase** in spatial rotation. Even the corresponding author warned: don’t read this as “Americans got less intelligent.” The dataset came from an *online personality* site; motivation/effort may differ between personality vs. ability items, and the study didn’t test causes. ([Northwestern Now][1])

* **Norway’s within-family study (PNAS 2018)**
  Using conscription data, researchers showed the long rise **and** the recent dip can be explained by **environmental** factors—*not* genetics shared within families. In practice: the “knob” is the environment, and it can be turned. ([PubMed][2])

* **Phones & attention: mixed results**
  Some studies report costs from the *mere presence* of a smartphone on working memory/attention; others **fail to replicate**, and meta-analyses disagree (one finds small negatives, another says effects are near-zero except possibly for working memory). Takeaway: distraction risk is real, but the “phone-on-the-desk automatically drains IQ” claim is **not settled**. ([Chicago Journals][3], [ScienceDirect][4], [PMC][5], [Open Science Framework][6])

* **Reading on paper vs. screens: often small, context-dependent advantages for print**
  Meta-analyses frequently find a **modest** print advantage—especially for expository/argument-dense texts or under time pressure—though newer work shows situations with **no overall difference**. So “how” and “what” you read matters. ([ScienceDirect][7], [Wiley Online Library][8])

* **Sleep & stimulation**
  Reviews suggest late, stimulating screen use can hurt sleep (timing/content may matter as much as “blue light”). Poor sleep hits attention/memory. This wasn’t tested in the IQ papers but is a reasonable, changeable lever. ([PMC][9], [ScienceDirect][10])

* **AI/LLMs and skill**
  A 2025 multicenter study in *The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology* found endoscopists’ **non-AI** performance dropped after routine AI exposure (adenoma detection rate fell \~6 points when AI was *off*), raising deskilling concerns—even as AI can help *when it’s on*. Causality needs more study, but over-reliance can change habits. ([PubMed][11], [TIME][12])

**Bottom line:** there’s evidence of declines in certain test scores, but the *cause* is not definitive. The Norwegian paper points to environment, which is actually good news: we can change ours.

## How this lands for me (and what I’m changing)

Over the last 2–3 years I’ve felt less sharp with writing and code. Some of that may be **how I use LLMs**: when I let them carry too much, my own reps go down. I’m not claiming I’ve solved it—I’m **working on it**, trying to improve and push back against mindless defaults.

* **Shorts & feeds:** I *try hard* not to watch Shorts. I still slip. I’m adding resistance—turning off recommendations, using desktop, search-first instead of scrolling—to cut how **often** and how **long** I fall in.
* **News:** I don’t follow daily news. Sometimes I’ll skim a physical paper at the library for 10–15 minutes for a high-level view; otherwise I stay out.
* **Phone at home:** I don’t stash it in the kitchen; it stays with me. Given the mixed evidence on “mere presence,” I’m focusing on **use patterns**: minimal notifications, no autoplay, intentional sessions. ([ScienceDirect][4], [PMC][5])
* **Analog-first planning:**

  * Fresh sheet each morning.
  * One *major* task, broken into small, visualizable steps.
  * Cross off as I go.
  * End-of-day `Today.md` with: top 3, meeting notes, done list; I draft tomorrow’s file the day before.
* **AI as tool, not crutch:**

  * I OCR my notebook so an LLM can **search my own notes** later.
  * I do a **no-look first pass** on code or prose, then ask AI to critique, generate tests, or propose alternatives.
  * I use it to quiz me, not to think *for* me.
* **Food vs. media:** I try to eat healthy; I still eat some junk. Same with **processed media**—keep it small; don’t make it the main course.

---

## A simple playbook (because the causes aren’t simple)

* **Add friction where you’re weakest**
  Turn off autoplay/recs. Move tempting apps off the home screen. Decide *before* opening YouTube what you’ll watch.
* **Do daily deep reading**
  30–60 minutes of long-form (paper or notification-free digital). Finish with 3 bullets or a tiny argument map. Evidence points to small but meaningful comprehension gains in the right contexts. ([ScienceDirect][7], [Wiley Online Library][8])
* **Protect sleep and stimulation**
  Set a nightly cut-off for hyped content. If screens late, lower brightness and choose calmer material. ([PMC][9])
* **Use AI in “Socratic mode”**
  Draft first → ask for critique, counter-arguments, edge cases, and a quiz on my notes. This keeps practice on *my* side while still getting AI’s speed. Deskilling is a risk if I over-delegate. ([PubMed][11])
* **Track inputs, not IQ**
  Count deep-work hours, pages read, paper-plan streaks, and practice reps. Review monthly; tweak.

## Why I’m optimistic

The Norway study highlights **environment** as the main driver. That means this isn’t fate. I’m not trying to be perfect—I’m trying to be **a bit better most days**. Less hype, fewer defaults, more intentional reps. If the environment shapes the mind, shaping my environment—app friction, reading blocks, sleep, and “AI as coach”—is the path forward.

## Sources (and what they actually claim)

* **U.S. trend (with cautions):** Northwestern Now report on a 2006–2018 online dataset; declines in three domains, spatial up; author warns scores ≠ “less intelligent” and notes possible motivation/test-context issues. ([Northwestern Now][1])
* **Within-family Norway study:** *PNAS* 2018 shows the rise, turning point, and decline can be recovered **within families**, implying environmental—not genetic—drivers. ([PubMed][2])
* **Smartphone presence & cognition:** Original “brain drain” paper (costs to working memory/fluid intelligence), a **failed replication**, and meta-analyses reaching **different** conclusions (from small negatives to near-zero overall, with a possible working-memory exception). My takeaway reflects that uncertainty. ([Chicago Journals][3], [ScienceDirect][4], [PMC][5], [Open Science Framework][6])
* **Reading medium:** Meta-analyses showing modest print advantages (esp. expository/under time pressure) and newer work with **no overall difference** depending on moderators/context. ([ScienceDirect][7], [Wiley Online Library][8])
* **Sleep & tech:** Reviews on light/timing/stimulation and sleep’s downstream cognitive effects. ([PMC][9], [ScienceDirect][10])
* **AI deskilling in practice:** *Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology* study (Poland; observational) linking **routine AI exposure** to a significant drop in non-AI adenoma detection rate; media summaries for context. (Helpful signal, not final word.) ([PubMed][11], [TIME][12])
* **Cal Newport’s essay motivating this reflection:** discussion of the Reverse Flynn Effect and hypotheses about digital media/smartphones; not a definitive causal claim. ([Cal Newport][13])
