Engineers can simulate a turbine’s tantrums or a chassis’s squeal. Many can even do it before lunch. Yet the same people will spend the afternoon hunting for **the** mesh, **the** temperature field, or **the** figure that clinched the argument in slide 27. The paradox is not new: we train people to master mathematics, not the mundane physics of folders.

In a world where careers, companies and compliance all depend on who can find what, **file organisation is not housekeeping. It is risk management.** The market for clarity is oddly inefficient. Most teams run a patchwork of personal conventions: one colleague sorts by feeling, another by vibe. The result is a familiar corporate sport—digital orienteering—where experience counts for less than luck.

This essay makes a modest case for a **shared framework** rather than a universal template. Think of it as lane markings for your digital motorway: light-touch rules that keep the traffic flowing, whatever you drive. It works whether your inputs are CFD pressure maps, thermal cycles from a chamber, or a spreadsheet of boundary conditions. Use what helps; ignore the rest.

## What problem are we actually solving?

Three, mainly.

**First, search time.** The unbilled hours lost to “Where did we put that?” rarely appear on a P&L, but they do appear in missed deadlines and frayed tempers.

**Second, trust.** Results without provenance are rumours with plots. If you cannot show which inputs produced which outputs, you will repeat work—or worse, defend it without evidence.

**Third, handover.** People resign, retire or simply change teams. Work that cannot be understood by someone new might as well not exist.

## The simple ideas (no commandments, just lanes)

### 1) Context before content  
Keep the top level clean and boring: **Projects**, **Areas**, **Resources**, **Archive** (PARA). Projects are living engagements; Areas are ongoing responsibilities (“Materials DB”, “Test Lab”); Resources are reusable knowledge (papers, vendor specs); Archive is the attic. This is not orthodoxy. It is a nudge to ask “what is this *for*?” before you ask “where should I click?”

### 2) A predictable spine per project  
Every project should feel familiar before you open a single file. A tidy skeleton—admin & comms, requirements, geometry, materials, **inputs** (whatever they are), models and runs, tests, validation, reports—turns “where?” into “obvious.” The point is not identical trees; it is **predictable places**.

### 3) Decisions are first-class citizens  
Most of engineering happens in prose: an email that narrows a tolerance, a chat that blesses a load case. Capture those as one-line entries in a humble `DECISIONS.md`, each with a link to the evidence (email, meeting notes, test report). You are not writing literature. You are laying breadcrumbs.

### 4) Run hygiene yields trust  
Treat each run (FEA, CFD, or otherwise) as a self-contained story: `inputs/`, `scripts/`, `results/` (raw and processed), `logs/`, plus a five-line README noting mesh/material set, boundary conditions, solver build and commit. If you cannot recreate a figure from the folder, the folder is not finished.

### 5) The right tool for the right byte  
Git is excellent at text. It sulks at heavy binaries. Use it for scripts and settings; keep giant artefacts (meshes, results, videos) in a proper data store or a tool designed for that job. If you must use large-file extensions, do so sparingly. Repositories should clone in minutes, not hours.

### 6) Small weekly synthesis beats yearly archaeology  
On Fridays, write a short note: outcomes achieved, decisions made, links to runs and evidence, one risk for next week. It is dull in the moment and miraculous later—especially when reviews, audits or memory turn up.

## Why this works (human, not heroic)

The framework avoids two traps. It does not ask you to rename the past; it asks you to **standardise today**. And it does not confuse detail with discipline. The value is not in fourteen subfolders for “misc.” The value is that **everyone shares a mental map**: projects look alike; decisions are logged; runs explain themselves.

It also respects incentives. Engineers distrust ceremony. Managers distrust chaos. Auditors distrust everyone. A light structure satisfies all three: it is quick to use, hard to break and easy to defend.

## What “good” looks like

- You can answer, “Which inputs produced Figure 12?” in under a minute.  
- A new colleague can navigate your project without a guided tour.  
- Ten years from now, you can open the folder and the work still explains itself.

## What this is not

It is not a universal taxonomy, nor an edict about where photos belong. It will not rescue every lost megabyte or resolve turf wars between Teams, SharePoint and shared drives. It is simply a **shared framework** that reduces friction where friction is worst.

## A gentle provocation

We have become virtuosos of the digital, yet we seldom teach the basics of living there. Universities will happily explain the weak form of a PDE; few bother with the weak form of a file system. No one needs a template for their soul. But a workplace benefits from a **shared framework**—especially when work must be understood by those who did not do it.

If you recognise the problem, take the parts you like and leave the rest. In **Part 2**, we will sketch an easy, step-by-step setup. In **Part 3**, we will bend it to your tools and habits, and show how to start small without the usual drama. For now, the thesis is plain: clarity is not a virtue reserved for prose. It belongs in your folders, too.
